## For developers

### How to try the module

The repository includes a docker-compose file to easily test the module. You can start the environment with the following command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will start a Magento 2 instance with the seQura module installed. You can access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8018/admin` with the credentials `admin`/`password123`.

Once installed you could start/stop the magento instance with `docker compose up` and `docker compose down` commands.

### Customizing the environment

You could create you own .env file to customize the environment. You can copy the .env.example file and modify the values as needed.

In order to use magento sample data you MUST set your credentials for https://repo.magento.com/ in you .env file at 

```bash
COMPOSER_AUTH='{"http-basic":{"repo.magento.com":{"username":"<public-key>","password":"<private-key>"}}}'
```

Otherwise you will get a warning message:

> "warning": "You haven't provided your Magento authentication keys. For instructions, visit https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html"

and the installation will fail.

#### Other examples

* You can customize the Magento version by setting the `MAGENTO_VERSION` environment variable.
* You can customize the sequra/magento module version by setting the `SQ_M2_CORE_VERSION` environment variable. Leave it as local to use the local version of the module.
* You can customize the host and ports by setting the `MAGENTO_HOST` and `MAGENTO_HTTP_PORT` environment variable.

### Loading sample data

You can load sample data with the following command:

```bash
./bin/install-sampledata
```

or setting the `MAGENTO_SAMPLEDATA` environment variable to `yes` when before running the ./setup.sh script.

> After installing sample data you may get 404 errors for http://${MAGENTO_HOST}/%7B%7BMEDIA_URL%7D%7Dstyles.css.
> To fix this issue go to Content -> Design -> Configuration -> Edit your theme -> HTML Head -> Scripts and Style Sheets and change the line with `{{MEDIA_URL}}styles.css` to `media/styles.css`
